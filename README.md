- 👋 Hi, I’m Pa Yeng Yang, you might remember me as @pyang0620
- 🌱 I’m currently in my junior year learning Data science at Metropolitan State University 
- 👀 How I got interset in Data science: As growing up math as always been one of my strength. Many people may say that Technology is what we all use everyday but little did they know it is math. If without math, technology wouldn't have exist and technology wouldn't be functionable. I just love the way how much numbers can be used to tell a stories and to make a descison everyday.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who has the same interset as I do on Data science. 
- 📫 How to reach me is by email: pyang0620@gmail.com
